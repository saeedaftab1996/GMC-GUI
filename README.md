GEOMECHANICS_GUI
GEOMECHANICS_GUI is an integrated MATLAB-based graphical user interface for calculating and visualizing subsurface geomechanical parameters. It processes standard well-log data to compute vertical, horizontal, and effective stresses, a gamma-ray–normalized brittleness proxy, elastic (Lame) parameters, uncertainty metrics, and sensitivity indices—all within one self-contained tool.

Features
Import Excel well-log data (Depth, Vp, Vs, Density, Porosity, Gamma Ray, Resistivity, optional ShaleVolume)

Compute lithostatic (vertical) stress, pore pressure, and horizontal stresses using Terzaghi’s effective­stress principle

Derive elastic parameters (λ and μ) and a brittleness proxy normalized by gamma ray response

Four interactive tabs:

Main Results: Depth‐plots and table of stresses and brittleness

Advanced Analysis: Scatter plots of λ vs μ, UCS vs effective stress, horizontal stress vs strain, tensile strength vs porosity

Advanced Statistics: Descriptive statistics (mean, std dev, median, min, max) plus standard error row and error‐bar chart (mean ± std dev)

Sensitivity Analysis: Coefficient of variation bar chart and sensitivity table for all parameters

Real-time replotting and interactive controls (checkboxes, buttons)

Self-documenting error alerts and data integrity checks
